# Installation

Vigolium ships as a single Go executable with embedded helper programs. The Go
executable is statically linked; the Linux helpers require a glibc-based runtime.
Browser features need a compatible browser. Pick whichever install method fits
your environment — all of them give you the same `vigolium` binary.

## Quick install (recommended)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://vigolium.com/install.sh | bash
```

The installer:

- resolves the latest release, downloads the matching binary, and **verifies
  it** before installing: npm tarballs against the registry's sha512
  `dist.integrity`, CDN archives against the SHA-256 in `checksums.txt` (and,
  when [`minisign`](https://jedisct1.github.io/minisign/) is installed, that
  file's release signature). A missing digest aborts the install;
- installs to `~/.local/bin/vigolium`;
- adds `~/.local/bin` to your `PATH` in the appropriate shell profile
  (`.zshrc`, `.bashrc`/`.bash_profile`, or `config.fish`).

If `~/.local/bin` was not already on your `PATH`, activate it without
restarting your shell:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
vigolium doctor
```

## npm

The npm package is a thin launcher that pulls the correct prebuilt binary for
your platform as an optional dependency (Node 16+).

```bash
# Global install
npm install -g @vigolium/vigolium

# Or run once without installing
npx @vigolium/vigolium scan -h
```

## Nix

The [official binary flake](https://github.com/vigolium/nix-vigolium) supports
Linux and macOS on x86_64 and aarch64:

```bash
nix run github:vigolium/nix-vigolium -- version
nix profile install github:vigolium/nix-vigolium
```

Nix flakes and `nix-command` must be enabled. Linux requires working user
namespaces for the embedded helpers' FHS runtime. Use `nix profile list` to find
the installed entry name, then `nix profile upgrade <entry-name>` to upgrade.

## Scoop (Windows)

With [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) installed, add the official bucket:

```powershell
scoop bucket add vigolium https://github.com/vigolium/scoop-bucket
scoop install vigolium
```

This installs the Windows x64 release. Upgrade with `scoop update vigolium` and
remove with `scoop uninstall vigolium`.

The Nix flake and Scoop bucket check new stable GitHub Releases hourly and update
after their installation checks pass. They are distributed directly from these
repositories; central nixpkgs/Scoop main-bucket inclusion is separate.

## Build from source

Requires **Go 1.27+**, `git`, and `make`. No C toolchain is needed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vigolium/vigolium.git
cd vigolium
make build
```

`make build` outputs `bin/vigolium` and installs the binary to `$GOPATH/bin`.

> **Do not** run `go build` directly. `make build` injects version metadata and
> guarantees a clean build; an ad-hoc `go build` produces a binary that reports
> the wrong version and may be left stale in the working tree.

To place the binary on your `PATH` explicitly (assuming `$GOPATH/bin` is on it):

```bash
make install
```

Other useful targets:
`make build-all` (cross-compile Linux/macOS/Windows), `make test-unit`
(fast tests), `make lint`. Run `make help` or inspect the `Makefile` for the
full list.

## Docker

```bash
docker pull j3ssie/vigolium:latest

# Run any command — the entrypoint is the vigolium binary
docker run --rm j3ssie/vigolium:latest scan -h

# Scan a target and write a report to the host
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/out" j3ssie/vigolium:latest \
  scan --stateless -t https://example.com --format jsonl -o /out/results

# Run the REST server; publish the port to the host's loopback only
docker run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:9002:9002 -e VIGOLIUM_API_KEY=change-me \
  j3ssie/vigolium:latest server
```

The images set `VIGOLIUM_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0`, because a server bound to the
container's own loopback is unreachable through a published port; outside a
container `vigolium server` binds `127.0.0.1` unless you pass `--host`. The
ingest proxy is not covered by that variable: inside a container give it
`--ingest-proxy-host 0.0.0.0` plus `--proxy-token` (or `--proxy-allow`).

## Verify the installation

```bash
vigolium version     # prints version, build, and commit
vigolium doctor      # validates environment, config, and optional dependencies
```

`vigolium doctor` is the fastest way to confirm everything is wired up
correctly — run it after any install or upgrade.

### Auto-install missing dependencies

Most of Vigolium's core scanning has no external dependencies, but some
optional features need extra tooling (a browser for SPA spidering, nuclei
templates for the known-issue scan, `bun`/`pi` for certain agent drivers). If
`doctor` reports a fixable item, let it install it for you:

```bash
vigolium doctor --fix              # auto-install/fix every failing check
vigolium doctor --fix --only chrome,nuclei   # fix only specific items
```

`--fix` prints the report, installs what's missing, then re-checks and shows
the updated status. `--only` accepts any of:
`nuclei`, `chrome`, `bun`, `claude`, `agent-browser`, `pi`, `piolium`, `skill`
(it has no effect without `--fix`). `skill` reinstalls the stale
`vigolium-scanner` coding-agent skill copies that `doctor` found in
`./.claude/skills`, `~/.claude/skills`, `./.agents/skills` or `~/.agents/skills`.

## Updating

`vigolium update` replaces the running binary with the latest signed release
and refreshes the local nuclei-templates checkout used by the known-issue scan:

```bash
vigolium update                  # update binary + nuclei templates
vigolium update --check          # is a newer release out? changes nothing
vigolium update --dry-run        # verify the signed release, download nothing
vigolium update --skip-templates # only update the binary
vigolium update --skip-binary    # only refresh nuclei templates
vigolium update --install-dir ~/.local/bin   # install a copy there instead
```

The update runs inside the binary (no shell or curl). It reads `metadata.json`,
`checksums.txt` and `checksums.txt.minisig` from one release prefix
(`https://cdn.vigolium.com/vigolium-release`, or `$VIGOLIUM_UPDATE_BASE_URL`),
verifies the [minisign](https://jedisct1.github.io/minisign/) signature
against the release keys built into the binary, checks the archive's SHA-256,
confirms the new binary's `version --json`, and only then renames it over the
running binary (symlinks resolved, so a `$PATH` symlink keeps pointing at the
updated file). Any failed check leaves the current binary untouched; re-running
the install script is always a working recovery path.

If the running binary's directory is not writable (for example
`/usr/local/bin`), the update stops with an error: re-run it with `sudo`, or
pass `--install-dir` to install a copy into a directory you own. `-j` prints a
mutation document (`changed`, `action`, `dry_run`, `from`, `to`, `path`,
`update_available`, and one item per step: `binary`, `templates`).

Vigolium also checks npm for a newer release on startup at most once per day.
Set `VIGOLIUM_DISABLE_UPDATE_CHECK=1` to suppress that notice, or
`VIGOLIUM_AUTO_UPDATE=1` to update and re-exec the newer binary automatically.
Auto-update only acts for a person at a terminal: it stays off under `-j`,
`--events`, `--ci-output-format`, when stdout or stderr is not a TTY, for
`vigolium server`, and when `CI` or a coding-agent variable (`VIGOLIUM_AGENT`,
`CLAUDECODE`, …) is set, so an agent never has its binary swapped mid-session.

> npm, Homebrew and Docker installs are upgraded through their own tooling
> (`npm install -g @vigolium/vigolium@latest` / `brew upgrade vigolium` /
> `docker pull`); `vigolium update` refuses to replace those binaries in place.

Packages produced by the additional distribution recipes record their package
manager. Releases containing this support disable binary self-updates for those
installs and direct you to the package manager instead. Template-only updates
remain available with `vigolium update --skip-binary`.

AUR, DEB/RPM, Scoop, WinGet, Nix, and Snap packages are built from the templates in
`build/packaging/`. Availability in each registry depends on completing that
channel's publishing setup.

## Where Vigolium stores data

Everything lives under `~/.vigolium/` (override with the `VIGOLIUM_HOME`
environment variable):

| Path | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `~/.vigolium/vigolium-configs.yaml` | Main configuration file |
| `~/.vigolium/database-vgnm.sqlite` | Default SQLite scan database |
| `~/.vigolium/agent-sessions/` | Agentic scan session artifacts |
| `~/.vigolium/prompts/` | User prompt templates |

Initialize the workspace and a starter config explicitly with:

```bash
vigolium init
```

## Uninstall

```bash
rm -f ~/.local/bin/vigolium      # or: $GOPATH/bin/vigolium for source installs
rm -rf ~/.vigolium               # optional: remove config, database, sessions
```

For npm: `npm uninstall -g @vigolium/vigolium`.
