// Execute returns (bool, error) where the bool is "produced findings" and the
// error is nil on every one of these paths: a cancelled feed, an abandoned
// drain, abandoned workers, a skipped deferred flush. Each of those silently
// reduces coverage, and the caller had no way to learn about any of them — a
// scan whose workers were abandoned mid-flight reported exactly what a clean one
// did. This is that missing channel.
