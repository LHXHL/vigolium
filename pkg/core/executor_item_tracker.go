// itemTracker owns one work item from the end of its dispatch phase until its
// last active-module task finishes. It is what lets a worker hand an item's
// slow tasks off and go back to the queue instead of pinning itself in a
// per-item Wait (head-of-line blocking: one 2-minute module task used to stop
// that worker from fetching any other baseline).
//
// Ownership: the worker owns the item, its pooled response buffer and the
// buffer guard while it fetches, runs the passive stage and dispatches the
// active tasks. From then on the tracker owns them. Every dispatched task holds
// a reference (pending), and so does the dispatcher until it calls done();
// whichever goroutine drops the last reference runs complete(), exactly once.
//
// complete() is the only place an item is finished: the pooled buffer goes
// back to the pool (unless an abandoned module call may still read it), the
// item is acknowledged (or counted unacked on a cancelled phase), Processed()
// advances, inFlight drops and the item's outstanding slot is released.
