// phase builds a fresh executor per feedback round, so this state used to reset
// between rounds: a cap documented as holding "for the remainder of the scan"
// actually restarted every round, and a root cause re-found in round 2 re-fired
// every callback and notification for a finding already reported in round 1.
// Sharing one admission across the phase's rounds is what makes the documented
// contract true (triage C7: per dynamic-assessment phase, shared across rounds;
// other phases are uncapped).
//
// The zero value is ready to use, so an Executor built without a shared one gets
// its own by construction and a literal &Executor{cfg: …} in a test still works.
