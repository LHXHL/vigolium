// Package fuzz is a low-level, agent-driven fuzzing primitive: inject a
// caller-supplied payload set into chosen positions of a single HTTP request,
// send each variant, and report per-payload response signals (status, size,
// words, lines, time, reflection, baseline delta) with match/filter gating.
//
// It is deliberately NOT a scanner. It makes no decision about *what* to test
// and emits no findings — the caller (a coding agent, or the vigolium module
// scanner) brings the intelligence; fuzz provides a fast, scope-aware,
// controllable send+observe loop. For opinionated, confirmation-backed
// vulnerability detection use the module scanner (`vigolium scan-request -m ...`)
// instead; fuzz reports raw signals for the caller to reason over.
//
// The send path, request parsing, and response hashing are reused verbatim from
// pkg/replay (replay.SendRaw); positions are resolved through pkg/httpmsg
// insertion points, so the byte-level injection matches what the module scanner
// does.
