//	app.example.com -> login.example.com/oauth2/authorize   (same apex)
//	app.example.com -> app.example.com/.auth/login/aad      (Azure EasyAuth)
//	app.example.com -> app.example.com/cdn-cgi/access/login (Cloudflare Access)

// Following any of them hands every passive and active module the identity
// provider's login page while the record, the findings and matched_at all still
// name the target — a report whose every line is about somebody else's server
// and which the target's owner cannot reproduce. The browser crawler has
// refused these since it learned to (crawler.evaluateStartRedirect); this is
// the same rule for the transport every other phase fetches through.
//
// Stopping means ErrUseLastResponse, so the 3xx itself becomes the response the
// caller sees, Location intact. That is strictly more informative than the
// login page: "this target is behind <wall>" is the finding, and callers that
// want the wall's host read it off Location.
//
// The origin is exempted when it already looks like an authentication endpoint.
// An operator who points the scanner AT an IdP means to scan the IdP, and every
// hop inside a login flow matches the same signatures — gating those would stop
// such a scan on its first redirect.
// Destination first: it is the discriminating test and it fails for almost
// every hop, so the origin — which is constant across a chain and therefore
