// Chrome for Testing before its first page: no configured path, no embedded
// engine binary, no working system browser and no cached CfT copy. It makes no
// network request; it does run `<browser> --version` on each system candidate
// until one answers.
//
// The scan runner asks this before the spidering phase starts its clock, and
// when it is true downloads the browser up front with progress, so a fresh
// machine's ~150 MB download is not charged to the crawl's time budget.
