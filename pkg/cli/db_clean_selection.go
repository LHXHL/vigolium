// `db clean` used to branch into its orphan, findings-only, table, and all-table
// handlers BEFORE resolving the project and the filters, and each of those
// handlers then built its own query from scratch. Three of the four ignored
// every selector on the command line:
//
//	vigolium db clean --findings-only --host staging.example --force
//
// read as "delete findings for that host" and deleted every finding in the
// store, across every project, because cleanFindingsOnly applied severity and
// nothing else. --orphans and --table constructed an empty QueryFilters, so
// they too swept the whole file regardless of the selected project.
//
// The shape of the bug is that --findings-only LOOKS like a narrowing modifier
// and is actually a mode switch. So the fix is not only to apply the filters: it
// is to resolve ONE selection up front that states its own scope, apply it
// identically to the preview, the count, and the delete, and reject a selector
// the chosen mode cannot honor instead of silently dropping it.

// cleanMode is the operation `db clean` was asked to perform. Exactly one is
// selected per invocation.
