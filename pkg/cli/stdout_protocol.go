// Who owns stdout.
//
// A scan command can be asked to write up to four different things there, and
// three of them are streams with no framing of their own:
//
//   - `--events ndjson`, one event object per line, for the whole run;
//   - `--format jsonl` with no -o, the bulk export streamed to stdout;
//   - `--ci-output-format`, one finding object per line;
//   - `--print-finding` / `--print-traffic` / `--print-traffic-tree`, Markdown.
//
// Any two of those interleave into a stream that is not what either contract
// describes: a consumer reading NDJSON events hits a Markdown heading, or two
// different object shapes on alternate lines with no `type` to tell them apart.
// Nothing detected the combination, so the corruption was silent and the exit
// code was 0.
//
// --events is the one that owns the stream, because it is the only one that
// writes DURING the run and therefore cannot be relocated after the fact: the
// others all have an -o or a file destination. So the rule is one-way: asking
// for --events alongside another stdout writer is a usage error (exit 2) naming
// the conflict and the fix, rather than a corrupt stream.

//
// -j is the other owner. On the scan commands it prints ONE scan document once
// the run is over (scan_document.go), and every other stdout writer — the
// event stream included — would put a second protocol in front of it. So -j
// with any of them is a usage error too; their file forms (-o for --format
// jsonl) stay available.

// validateStdoutProtocol rejects a flag set in which -j's scan document or
// --events would share stdout with another writer. It is a no-op when neither
// was asked for.
