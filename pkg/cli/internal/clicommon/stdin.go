// --input-read-timeout was registered on scan, run, and ingest, documented as
// "Timeout for reading input from stdin or file", defaulted to 3m, and read by
// nothing. It was assigned into Options.InputReadTimeout and no consumer ever
// looked at that field, so the control was inert repo-wide:
//
//	( sleep 30 ) | vigolium scan --input-read-timeout 2s
//
// blocked for the full 30 seconds. Fourteen call sites reached for a bare
// io.ReadAll(os.Stdin), which has neither a deadline nor a size bound, so a
// producer that never closes its end hung the process forever with no way for
// the caller to bound it. For an agent driving vigolium from a shell tool that
// is unrecoverable: the tool call never returns.
//
// ReadBounded is the one reader. io.ReadAll cannot be cancelled once it is
// blocked in read(2), so the read runs on its own goroutine and the deadline is
// enforced by the caller side of a channel. The goroutine is left blocked on
// timeout rather than being forced to unwind: it holds only a buffer, the
// process is on its way to reporting the failure, and there is no portable way
// to interrupt a pending read on a pipe.

// DefaultStdinLimit bounds a single stdin read. It is deliberately generous —
// a HAR or a Burp export piped in can be large, and the deadline, not the size
// cap, is what protects against a producer that never finishes. The cap exists
// so a runaway or hostile producer cannot drive the process out of memory.

//
// On timeout it returns what the deadline is, not a generic I/O error: the
// caller is expected to surface --input-read-timeout as the dial that changes
// it, because "vigolium hung" is otherwise indistinguishable from "the producer

// ErrStdinNoData marks an input that produced no byte at all within the
// first-byte window. It is distinct from ErrStdinTimeout: nothing arrived, so
// the input was most likely an inherited pipe nobody writes to, not a slow
// producer that started and stalled.
var ErrStdinNoData = errors.New("no data on stdin")

// ReadBoundedWait reads r subject to a size limit, a first-byte deadline and a
// total deadline.
//
// An inherited stdin is indistinguishable from a piped one: a CI runner, an
// agent harness or a supervisor hands the child a pipe it never writes to, and
// fileutil.HasStdin reports it as "piped". A command that drains stdin only
// because it MIGHT carry input then sat for the full --input-read-timeout
// before failing with "no targets". firstByte bounds that guess: when it is
// positive and no byte (and no EOF) arrives within it, the read gives up with
// ErrStdinNoData. Once the first byte (or EOF) arrives the producer is real,
// and total — measured from that first byte — bounds the rest.
//
// A zero or negative firstByte disables the first-byte phase, and total is then
// measured from the start; that is ReadBounded. A zero or negative total means
// no overall deadline. An EOF with zero bytes returns an empty slice and no
// error at once: an empty pipe is an answer, not a stall.
//
// NOTE for a future caller: on a deadline the read goroutine is left blocked.
// Every caller today is one-shot and on its way to reporting the failure and
// exiting, so the abandoned goroutine and its buffer live for microseconds. A
// long-lived caller that times out repeatedly would leak one goroutine per
// timeout.
