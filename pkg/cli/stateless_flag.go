// -S used to mean two different things depending on which command you typed it
// after: --stateless on scan/export/finding/replay/agent-audit, and
// --scan-on-receive on server/ingest. A third group (log, and traffic's
// --save-to-vigolium-db path) rejected it outright with "unknown shorthand
// flag" — a non-zero exit and no output, which is the worst of the three: a
// driver passing -S for safety got a control that looked live and could only
// ever report zero rows.
//
// Two changes retire the trap:
//
//  1. On server/ingest the shorthand is retired. --scan-on-receive is the only
//     spelling; -S is a usage error (exit 2) naming it, for one release, so a
//     command line that meant "scan what you receive" fails loudly rather than
//     silently turning into "scan nothing". After that release the hidden flag
//     goes and addStatelessShorthand gives these two commands -S/--stateless
//     like every other.
//  2. --stateless is accepted everywhere as a persistent root flag. On a command
//     where it is meaningless it is a documented no-op — a flag that is harmless
//     everywhere is one a driver never has to keep a per-command acceptance
//     table for.
//
// The root flag is deliberately LONG-ONLY. Giving it the -S shorthand at root
// level would collide with the local -S the read commands and the deprecated
// scan-on-receive tombstone still register, and pflag resolves that by panicking
// at startup rather than by picking one.

// retiredScanOnReceiveShorthand backs the hidden -S tombstone on server/ingest.
// Its value is never used: typing the flag at all is the error.

// collide with the commands that still bind -S themselves, and pflag resolves
// that by panicking at startup rather than by shadowing. Registering per command
// is what lets those keep theirs while every other command accepts the letter.
//
// One structural guard, no exemption list: the letter is free unless the
// command, or a persistent flag it inherits, already binds it. That covers the
// commands with their own -S/--stateless and the `server`/`ingest` retired
// --scan-on-receive tombstone, and self-heals when the tombstone is finally
// removed. Inherited flags are read from the ancestors' PersistentFlags rather
// than from the command's merged flagset, so the guard never depends on whether
// cobra has merged them yet. A name-keyed exemption list would rot in both
// directions: rename a command and it silently stops matching; add a third -S
// owner and the two mechanisms disagree about which is authoritative.
//
// On a read command -S is meaningful (read --db with project scoping off);
// elsewhere it is a documented no-op. Both beat "unknown shorthand flag", which
// exits non-zero with no output — a control that looks live and can only ever
