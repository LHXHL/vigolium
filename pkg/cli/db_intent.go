// checkpointing), so the command never waits on a scan writing the same file.
// Only commands that provably never write belong there: a write through the
// read pool fails loudly ("attempt to write a readonly database"), which is the
// right failure for a mis-declared command but still a failure. When in doubt,
// "write" — it is the behaviour every command had before.
