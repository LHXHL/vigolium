A patched PHP with a low memory_limit can crash the same way, so treat this as a lead to verify against the installed version.

**How it's exploited:** An unauthenticated attacker sends crafted multipart requests to any PHP script, crashing workers at will and, on affected builds, reaching remote code execution.

**Fix:** Upgrade PHP to 8.2.35, 8.3.36, 8.4.27, 8.5.12 or later (or the vendor backport), and cap request body size at the web server.`
