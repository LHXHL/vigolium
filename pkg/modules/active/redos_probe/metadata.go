Confirmed when growing "aaaa…!" inputs add delay that grows faster than their length across two rounds, while same-length inputs that match stay fast.

**How it's exploited:** An attacker sends a few short crafted values that each occupy a worker for seconds or longer, exhausting the server's capacity and denying service to every user.

**Fix:** Rewrite the pattern without nested or overlapping quantifiers, cap input length before matching, or use a linear-time regex engine (RE2).`
