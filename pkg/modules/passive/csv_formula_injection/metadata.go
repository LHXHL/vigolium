**How it's exploited:** An attacker stores a value such as =HYPERLINK(...) or a DDE command in a field that lands in an export. When a victim opens the file, the formula leaks data or launches commands.

**Fix:** Prefix cells starting with = + - @ tab or carriage return with an apostrophe, and quote every field.`
