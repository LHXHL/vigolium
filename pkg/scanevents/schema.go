// Event is one struct for every type, so the struct alone cannot say which
// keys a given type's line carries. eventFields is that table, and the source
// of `vigolium schema event`: per type, the keys a line always carries
// (required) and the keys it may carry (optional), on top of the spine every
// line has.
//
// Keep it in step with the emit sites. schema_test.go fails when a type in
// Types has no row, when a row names a key Event does not have, or when an
// Event key belongs to no type.
