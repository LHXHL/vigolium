// Package scanevents is the machine-readable event stream a scan emits on
// stdout, alongside (never instead of) the human console render on stderr.
//
// The contract has one job: let a program that spawned `vigolium scan` learn
// what the scan is doing while it runs, without reading anything that was
// formatted for a terminal. Every consumer fact — which phase, how far, whether
// the edge started filtering, what was found — is a field on a line here, so
// nothing downstream has to regex a rendered log to recover it.
//
// Four rules make the stream usable and must not regress:
//
//   - Stdout only, and only when --events is passed. The stderr console is
//     byte-for-byte unchanged whether or not a stream is attached, so an
//     interactive operator sees no difference and a driver gets clean NDJSON out
//     of `2>/dev/null`.
//   - Every event carries ScanUUID. One sweep is several `vigolium scan`
//     invocations; an event a consumer cannot attribute to an invocation is an
//     event it cannot use.
//   - One line, one flush. A consumer polling a pipe must see phase.progress
//     while the phase runs. Buffering to exit would turn the stream back into a
//     post-mortem log, which is the thing it exists to replace.
//   - A terminal event on every exit path we can reach, including SIGINT/SIGTERM
//     (status "interrupted"). SIGKILL cannot be caught, which is fine: the
//     ABSENCE of a terminal event is itself the signal, and only stays that way
//     if every reachable path emits one.
