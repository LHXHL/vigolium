//     with no_targets_reachable; its assessment is marked skipped, because no
//     module had a baseline to work on.
//   - interrupted is an operator/caller cancellation; it outranks every other
//     stop reason because it is the cause of whatever else went missing.
//   - execErr is Execute's error, counted against the assessment.
//   - tally is the CLI-target tally (see DirectTargetTally). A zero tally is
//     "not counted" and adds no preflight outcome. Requested targets that scope
//     admitted none of stop with no_targets_in_scope (hook for scope admission
