# Vigolium

Go web vulnerability scanner with a CLI, REST API, traffic ingestion, and an in-process AI runtime. Module: `github.com/vigolium/vigolium`; Go version: see `go.mod` (currently 1.27+).

## Build and test

Always build with `make build` or `make install` to preserve version injection. Never build directly to `./vigolium` or an ad-hoc path.

```bash
make build              # bin/vigolium; also installs to $GOPATH/bin
make test-unit          # Fast tests (-short)
make test               # Full test suite
make test-race          # Race detector
make test-e2e           # Docker required
make test-canary        # Docker required
make lint               # golangci-lint
make fmt                # Format code
```

For a focused change: `go test -short -run TestName ./pkg/path/...`. Run relevant tests; use race tests for concurrency changes.

Do not read or modify `platform/`. The only exception is `platform/vigolium-workbench/` for UI work.

## Important contracts

- **Native scanning:** ingestion → scope filtering → executor → modules → output/storage. Native scans are deterministic Go code. AI dispatch uses the in-process olium runtime.
- **Modules:** implement `ActiveModule` or `PassiveModule`, register in `default_registry_active.go` or `default_registry_passive.go`, and reuse `modkit`/`infra` helpers. Passive modules analyze existing traffic without sending requests.
- **Projects:** scan data is scoped by `project_uuid`. Config precedence is global → project → scanning profile → CLI. Preserve project isolation in queries and writes.
- **Database selection:** `--db` → `VIGOLIUM_DB_PATH` → config → default. Reuse shared DB openers and scoping helpers; a pinned env path must never silently fall back to another store.
- **Inputs:** `-T` accepts target lists (URLs or Burp scope); specs and request exports use `-i`. Target lists must populate `Options.Targets` before runner creation.
- **Shared definitions:** input formats belong in `pkg/input/source/file.go`; phase names/aliases in `internal/runner/native_plan.go`. Extend these tables instead of maintaining parallel lists.
- **Machine output:** keep human logs off stdout in JSON/event modes. Reuse the shared JSON envelope and event emitter; `-j` query output and `--format jsonl` exports have distinct contracts.
- **Large datasets:** stream exports and hydrate evidence on demand. Glob merges use temporary file databases; avoid loading whole raw-traffic corpora into memory.
